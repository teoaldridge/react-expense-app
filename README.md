# react-expense-app
In this exercise I used react to create an expense app, which includes an expense form to submit expense details, a list of expenses that is rendered according to a chosen year, and a chart, showing the amount of expenses in each month. Please read more in the README file.


I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

In this exercise, I learnded and practiced: 
- react Components
- creating a new react project
- JSX 
- building custom components
- styling components with CSS
- outputting dynamic data and working with expressions in JSX
- passing data via props
- adding normal JavaScript logic to components
- the concept of "composition"("children props")
- organising component files
- event handlers and listening to events
- how component functions are executed
- working with 'state'
- the 'useState' hook
- different ways to update state
- adding a form input
- listening to user input
- working with multiple states
- using only one state instead (and what's better)
- updating state that depends on previous state
- handling form submission
- adding two-way binding
- child-to-parent communication (bottom-up)
- lifting the state up
- controlled vs uncontrolled and stateless vs stateful components
- rendering lists of data
- using stateful lists
- understanding 'keys'
- outputting conditionale content
- adding conditional return statements
- adding a chart
- adding dynamic styles

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
